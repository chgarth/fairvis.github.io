## 1st Workshop on FAIR Principles in <br> Visualization Research and Practice

The [FAIR principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible) for scientific data
management are widely recognized as a gold standard of open research
practice. They are increasingly adopted by scientists in their research
processes, and are already frequently required by funding agencies such
as the European Research Council (ERC) and others. Distinct from other
open data initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR
Principles put specific emphasis on machine legibility, in addition to
supporting its reuse by individuals. 

While data could simply be viewed as an object of visualization, a more
holistic approach considers visualizations derived from data as
(graphical) data products, subjecting the visualization process itself
to the FAIR principles.

FAIRvis aims bring together experts in visualization and FAIR data
practices to discuss two core questions at the intersection of
visualization research and scientific data management:

1. **How can visualization systems and methods be useful in supporting
   FAIR research practices?** What are (potential) roles of
   visualization in supporting researchers in finding, organizing,
   annotating with metadata, and reusing research data?

2. **How can visualization processes and products be FAIR?** How can
   they be (more) effectively annotated and shared, made (more)
   interoperable and (more) reproducible?

FAIRvis' dual aim is to a) take inventory of the state of FAIRness of
visualization research and practice, and b) identify open problems for
the visualization community to address in future research, such that
visualization can flourish in a FAIR future.


<!-- # Intended Outcomes



* Bring together experts from visualization and FAIR scientific workflows to jointly author a survey / state-of-the-art report on FAIR aspects of visualization. 
* Start organizing a community at the intersection of visualization and FAIR research, to identify and work on a research program in FAIR visualization (e.g., continued through future workshops or [Dagstuhl] seminars).

### Organizers


* _Min Chen (University of Oxford)_
* _Christoph Garth (TU Kaiserslautern)_ – In his prior research,  Christoph has worked on individual aspects of FAIRness in visualization, focusing chiefly on reproducibility and computational workflows involving visualization. Furthermore, Christoph is a PI in the DataPLANT project, where he investigates visualization aspects of research data management workflows in plant biology.
* _Heike Leitte (TU Kaiserslautern) – _In her prior research, Heike has worked on the FAIR principles in data visualization focusing on knowledge representation, externalisation and integration. She is a PI in the NFDI consortia DataPLANT and MatWerk, which target FAIR data management in biology and material science & engineering.
* _Christina Gillmann (University of Leipzig) – _In her prior research, Christina aimed to use FAIR principles in order to promote the use of visualization research in a variety of applications such as medicine, biology, urban planning and mechanical engineering. She is part of the SCADS.AI (Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence), which is a center of competence that aims to develop novel visualization and artificial intelligence approaches under the FAIR principles.
* _N. N. – _to be recruited from outside EU


### Progam

The FAIRvis program is currently under construction – please check back soon.

<!-- We currently envision a half-day workshop, with the following coarse outline:

_Session 1:_



* Opening (10 mins)
* Keynote + Q&A (45 + 5 mins)
* 3-5 invited short talks by experts in visualization with prior work relevant to FAIR (40 mins total)

_Session 2:_



* 3-5 invited short talks by experts in research data management / FAIR data (40 mins total)
* group discussion / break-out sessions 
* Further Steps and Closing -->


<!-- # Why hold FAIRvis as a workshop at Eurovis 2023?

As FAIR research practices are becoming increasingly relevant to successful publication of results and securing funding, visualization methods, tools, and processes must meet the needs of domain researchers, which they currently do not sufficiently. By the same mechanisms, visualization research itself is incentivized to become FAIRer in the future. Thus, the timing is right to begin a concerted effort within the community toward addressing both goals.

Through providing 70M€ in funding per year over a period of five years, the German Joint Science Conference has incentivized the formation of research data management consortia that aim at developing and supporting domain-specific implementations of FAIR workflows. Holding FAIRvis at EuroVis in Leipzig would directly increase participation by these key stakeholders, to the benefit of the relevance of the workshop outcomes. (Christoph Garth and Heike Leitte are both PIs in corresponding consortia.) -->
