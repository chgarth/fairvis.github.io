The [FAIR principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)
(**F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, **R**eproducible) for scientific data
management are widely recognized as a gold standard of open research
practice. They are increasingly adopted by scientists in their research
processes, and are already frequently required by funding agencies such
as the European Research Council (ERC) and others. Distinct from other
open data initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR
Principles put specific emphasis on machine legibility, in addition to
supporting its reuse by individuals. 

A holistic approach to research data management not only considers
FAIRness of data, but extends to *all* processes and artifacts used to
obtain research results, including visualization and subjecting
it to FAIR requirements.

**FAIRvis** aims bring together experts in visualization and FAIR data
practices to discuss two core questions at the intersection of
visualization research and scientific data management:

1. **How can visualization systems and methods be useful in supporting
   FAIR research practices?** What are (potential) roles of
   visualization in supporting researchers in finding, organizing,
   annotating with metadata, and reusing research data?

2. **How can visualization processes and products be FAIR?** How can
   they be (more) effectively annotated and shared, made (more)
   interoperable and (more) reproducible?

**FAIRvis**' dual aim is to a) take inventory of the state of FAIRness of
visualization research and practice, and b) identify open problems for
the visualization community to address in future research, such that
visualization can flourish in a FAIR future.

### Call for Participation

In order to initiate a lively discussion in the FAIRvis Workshop, we
call for **lightning talks** on open problems in FAIR visualization or on
existing use of FAIR practices in and for visualization. 

Lightning talks should be approximately 5 minutes long and may include
any results, experiences, or insights in relation to visualization and the FAIR
principles. 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- metadata annotation of visualizations and visualization workflows 
- reproducibility in visualization 
- implementation-agnostic description of visualizations
- provenance visualization and provenance of visualizations
- domain-specific FAIR visualization solutions
- visualization across large-scale user bases 
- visualization archives and libraries 
- FAIR best practices for visualization research 
- examples of (un)successful usage of FAIR principles in visualization research 
- evaluation on the FAIRness in visualization research 
- extension of FAIR principles for visualization 

If you would like to participate, please send a short abstract of the talk
that you are planning to give (approx. 200 words) as well as your
information (name, affiliation, research interest) to
[gillmann@informatik.uni-leipzig.de](mailto:gillmann@informatik.uni-leipzig.de).

##### Important Dates

- **May 21, 2023** deadline for lightning talk submissions
- **June 12, 2023** FAIRvis workshop

### Program

The **FAIRvis** program is currently under construction – please check back soon.

### Organizers


* Min Chen (University of Oxford)
* Christoph Garth (RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau)
<!-- In his prior research,  Christoph has worked on individual aspects of FAIRness in visualization, focusing chiefly on reproducibility and computational workflows involving visualization. Furthermore, Christoph is a PI in the DataPLANT project, where he investigates visualization aspects of research data management workflows in plant biology. -->
* Christina Gillmann (University of Leipzig)
<!-- In her prior research, Christina aimed to use FAIR principles in order to promote the use of visualization research in a variety of applications such as medicine, biology, urban planning and mechanical engineering. She is part of the SCADS.AI (Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence), which is a center of competence that aims to develop novel visualization and artificial intelligence approaches under the FAIR principles. -->
* Heike Leitte (RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau) 
<!-- In her prior research, Heike has worked on the FAIR principles in data visualization focusing on knowledge representation, externalisation and integration. She is a PI in the NFDI consortia DataPLANT and MatWerk, which target FAIR data management in biology and material science & engineering. -->
<!-- * _N. N. – _to be recruited from outside EU -->



<!-- We currently envision a half-day workshop, with the following coarse outline:

_Session 1:_



* Opening (10 mins)
* Keynote + Q&A (45 + 5 mins)
* 3-5 invited short talks by experts in visualization with prior work relevant to FAIR (40 mins total)

_Session 2:_



* 3-5 invited short talks by experts in research data management / FAIR data (40 mins total)
* group discussion / break-out sessions 
* Further Steps and Closing -->


<!-- # Why hold FAIRvis as a workshop at Eurovis 2023?

As FAIR research practices are becoming increasingly relevant to successful publication of results and securing funding, visualization methods, tools, and processes must meet the needs of domain researchers, which they currently do not sufficiently. By the same mechanisms, visualization research itself is incentivized to become FAIRer in the future. Thus, the timing is right to begin a concerted effort within the community toward addressing both goals.

Through providing 70M€ in funding per year over a period of five years, the German Joint Science Conference has incentivized the formation of research data management consortia that aim at developing and supporting domain-specific implementations of FAIR workflows. Holding FAIRvis at EuroVis in Leipzig would directly increase participation by these key stakeholders, to the benefit of the relevance of the workshop outcomes. (Christoph Garth and Heike Leitte are both PIs in corresponding consortia.) -->
